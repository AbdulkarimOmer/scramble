## Route params
All the params from the route are added to the docs.

For example, when you have this route:
```
PUT /todo-items/{todoItem}
```

`todoItem` is added to the docs as a route parameter. When `todoItem` is a route parameter that uses model binding, Scramble will automatically set a type to `integer` and a description will be added in format `The todo item ID`.

You can override the parameter type and description in docs by providing a PhpDoc comment to the controller's method.
```php
use App\Models\TodoItem;

class TodoItemsController
{
    /**
     * @param string $item The todo item being updated.
     */
    public function update(Request $request, TodoItem $item)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```
This will override defaults and the `todoItem` parameter in docs will have `string` type and corresponding description from the PhpDoc.

## Body
Scramble understands the request body based on request validation rules.

This is the source of truth both for the code and for the docs.

Currently, there are 2 ways of validating requests that are understood by Scramble:

- Call to `validate` on `$request` or `$this` in controllerâ€™s method
- Call to `Validator` facade's `make` method with method call on request (`$request->?()`) as a first argument
- `rules` method on custom `FormRequest` class

```php
use App\Models\TodoItem;

class TodoItemsController
{
    public function update(Request $request, TodoItem $item)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'body' => ['required', 'string'],
            'is_complete' => 'bool',
        ]);
    }
}
```

Based on these validation rules Scramble knows that there are 2 request body params: `body` and `is_complete`.

Same applies to `Validator::make` call.

```php
use App\Models\TodoItem;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;

class TodoItemsController
{
    public function update(Request $request, TodoItem $item)
    {
        Validator::make($request->all(), [
            'body' => ['required', 'string'],
            'is_complete' => 'bool',
        ]);
        // ...
    }
}
```

The same applies to the `rules` method in custom `FormRequest`.

### Documenting request params manually

You can add docs to your request params by adding PHPDoc block near a validation rules of the param:

```php
use App\Models\Location;

class LocationsController
{
    public function update(Request $request, Location $location)
    {
        $request->validate([
            /**
             * The location coordinates.
             * @var array{lat: float, long: float} 
             * @example {"lat": 50.450001, "long": 30.523333}
             */
            'coordinates' => 'array',
        ]);
    }
}
```

`@example` should be either a string, or valid JSON. 

You can use `@var` to re-define or clarify type inferred from validation rules. Manually defined type will always take precedence over the automatically inferred type. 

A simple PHP comment before a param will also be used as a request body parameter description:
```php
use App\Models\TodoItem;

class TodoItemsController
{
    public function update(Request $request, TodoItem $item)
    {
        $request->validate([
            // Whether the task is complete.
            'is_complete' => 'bool',
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Rules evaluation caveats

It is important to keep in mind that rules are evaluated to be analyzed: `rules` method is called when there is a custom request class and the array with rules passed to the `validate` is evaluated as well.

This adds not obvious benefits to the resulting documentation when `Rule::in` validation rule is being represented as `enum` with all possible values in the docs.

But also it requires a developer to write rules in certain way when using validation via `validate` method call in controller. Only these expressions can be evaluated correctly:

- Using variables passed to the controller
- Static calls to classes
- Using global functions (`app()`)

Declaring local variable in method before calling `validate` and using it there will cause an error.

### Supported rules
- `required`
- `string`
- `bool`, `boolean`
- `number`
- `int`, `integer`
- `array`
- `in`, `Rule::in`
- `nullable`
- `email`
- `uuid`
- `exists` (marks value as `int` if attribute name is either `id` or `*_id`)
- `min` (numeric types only)
- `max` (numeric types only)
- `Enum`

## Adding Title and Description

Scramble can get endpoint docs from PhpDoc comment of the route's method.

`summary` is the first row of the doc. `description` is the other text in doc. When there is only one line of text in PhpDoc it is treated as `summary`, as you can expect.

```php
/**
 * This is summary.
 * 
 * This is a description. In can be as large as needed and contain `markdown`.
 */
```

## Organizing by Folders
All the endpoints are organized in folders by controller name. Endpoint organization in rendered docs is based on OpenAPI operation's tags.

When there are a lot of controllers in your application, you will have a ton of folders, and it may be hard to navigate through that list of folders.

You can add your own tags on the controller's level using `@tags` in PhpDoc. This will put all the routes from that controller in this folder. It allows you to reduce the amount of folders in rendered docs and organize the docs in a way that makes more sense.

Multiple tags are supported: simply write them in one line separated via comma.

> **Note** Please note that the UI Scramble uses for rendering docs doesn't support nested folders. It uses the first tag as a folder. Other tags will still be there in OpenAPI documentation but won't be shown in the UI.

```php
/**
 * @tags Media
 */
class DownloadMediaController
{
   public function show(Media $mediaItem)
   {
      return $mediaItem;
   }
}
```
