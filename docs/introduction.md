Scramble is OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation generator for Laravel. It generates API documentation for your project automatically without requiring you to manually write PHPDoc annotations. 

The documentation is generated in OpenAPI 3.1.0 format. To show the documentation in UI, [Stoplight Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/elements) is used.

The main motto of the project is to generate as much API documentation automatically as possible. This allows you to focus on code and avoid annotating every possible param/field as it may result in outdated documentation. By generating docs automatically from the code your API will always have up-to-date documentation you can trust.
