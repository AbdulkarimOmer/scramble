Scramble generates API documentation from codebase. Without requiring you to manually write annotations. 

Docs are generated in OpenAPI 3.1.0 format. To show the documentation, [Spotlight Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/elements) is used.

The main motto of the project is to generate as much API documentation automatically as possible. This allows you to focus on code and avoid annotating every possible param/field as it may result in outdated documentation. By generating docs automatically from the code your API will always have up-to-date docs which you can trust.
